## Multi Porcessing 
- Significantly speed up our program
- Help to speed up the processing 
- Improve the speed and helps to parallelize the functioning of the model

---

Some task dont need to be run synchronous , we can run them paralelly 

### CPU Bound tasks
* Tasks without synchronous , can be splt and could be run paralelly
* Need a lot of computation , crunching the numbers and need a lot of cu compute power
* 

# IO Bound Tasks
- No usage for lot of compute power , rather wait for processing for input and output tasks 
- File system operations and networkign operations
